            <h1>History of Classical Music</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card" id="hist-intro">
            Over the past 4-5 centuries the portrayal of music has dramatically changed in many
        different ways. This page focuses on the 4.5 periods since 1685, as described on the home
        page. Welcome to classical music history in a nutshell. Let's zoom 338 years into the past.
        </div>
        <div class="card" id="hist-baroque"><img src="../images/Bach_face.jpg" alt="bach">
            The first period is known as the Baroque period, and it is recognized to have lasted
            for pretty much the life of J.S. Bach, from his birth in 1685 to his death in 1750. The Baroque
            period is characterized by its heavy use of motifs and static but sudden dynamic changes... (Add more
            later) <br><br>
            Strings, the clavichord, and the harpsichord were very popular instruments in this era.
            <br><br>Notable composers include George Frideric Handel, Johann Sebastian Bach, and others.

        <div class="card" id="hist-classic"><img src="../images/beeth_oven.jpg" alt="beeth oven">
            The second period is the Classical period. Known for greater ranges of dynamics and more creativity than Baroque...
            <br><br>As a keyboard instrument the harpsichord was largely replaced by the fortepiano, now often known just 
            as the piano. This allowed for more dynamic... well, dynamics, instead of the statically changing dynamics of the 
            Baroque period. This in turn led to more emotional expression at the keyboard. Many types of concertos, often 
            being comprised of a solo instrument player over an ensemble, also began to appear.<br><br>
            Notable composers include Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, Schubert and others. Characterized with more freedom of time, 
            key, Many well-known pieces come from this period, such as Fur Elise.
        </div>
        <div class="card" id="hist-romantic"><img src="../images/hit_liszt.jpg" alt="liszt">
            After that was the Romantic period, probably my favorite of the periods personally. Known for much more 
            grandieur, much more emotion (Not that there wasn't as much in previous periods, this one just took it to 
            another level) and the music was also much more individualistic. There was also more chromaticism, which is 
            the use of notes that are not within a key.<br><br>Notable composers include Liszt, 
            Rachmaninoff, Chopin, Mendelssohn and many others. 
        </div>
        <div class="card" id="hist-impressionist">
            Then came what I call "The half period." The Impressionist period is characterized by its
            watercolor-like feel. If you can imagine fluttery, pastelly music, that is this period. Notable
            composers include Claude Debussy (Not to be confused with Claude Monet, an impressionist painter. I mean 
            seriously, what is up with Claudes and the impressionist period?) and Maurice Ravel.
        </div>
        <div class="card" id="hist-contemporary"><img src="../images/cage.jpg" alt="cage">
            Contemporary Period... The modern period. Everything went out the window, music is now 
        Turing complete. Write a piece in the phrygian mode and 13/8, except every 3 measures it's 15/8 just 
        to piss everyone off (If you don't know what that means, that's the point of contemporary music). This period 
        draws a lot from non-classical music as well, such as electronic, rock, pop, and other genres. 
        Notable composers include John Cage, Phillip Glass, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and others.
