            <h1>History of Classical Music</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card"id="hist-intro">
            Over the past 4-5 centuries the portrayal of music has dramatically changed in many
        different ways. This page focuses on the 4.5 periods since 1685, as described on the home
        page.
        </div>
        <div class="card"id="hist-baroque">
            The first period is known as the Baroque period, and it is recognized to have lasted
        for pretty much the life of J.S. Bach, from his birth in 1685 to his death in 1750. The Baroque
        period is characterized by its heavy use of motifs and static but sudden dynamic changes... blah 
        blah blah. This is an informational site, I am not going to add literally everything here.
        </div>
        <div class="card"id="hist-classic">
            Classical period... Known for greater ranges of dynamics and more creativity than Baroque...
        Notable composers... Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, Schubert etc. Characterized with more freedom of time, 
        key, Many well-known pieces come from this period.
        </div>
        <div class="card"id="hist-romantic">
            Romantic Period... Known for much more grandieur, much more emotion (Not that there wasn't 
        As much in previous periods, this one just took it to another level)... Notable composers... Liszt, 
        Rachmaninoff, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. 
        </div>
        <div class="card"id="hist-impressionist">
            Impressionist Period... The half period. Watercolor-like. Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel. The half-period.
        </div>
        <div class="card"id="hist-contemporary">
            Contemporary Period... The modern period. Everything went out the window, music is now 
        Turing complete. Write a piece in the phrygian mode and 13/8, except every 3 measures it's 15/8 just 
        to piss everyone off. Notable composers? I'll do this later. I don't know if John Cage counts.
