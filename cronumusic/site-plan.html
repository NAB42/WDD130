      <p>
        Cronumusic is a website designed to group many different elements of music theory 
        and how it changed over time into one site. It goes over a plethora of things, from 
        the different music periods to voice leading and chord progression. 
        <br><br>One page goes over the 4.5 periods of music since the late 17th century, Going over 
        the Baroque, Classic, Romantic, Impressionist, and Contemporary periods, their styles, and their 
        instrumentation.<br><br>
        The other page goes over basics of music theory, starting at introducing the grand staff and going to
        (I have no idea! Music theory is nearly endless).<br><br>
        Maybe I'll add a list of helpful links, and FAQs, and possibly some other crap to make my home page 
        useful.

      <h3>History of Music Theory</h3>
      <p>
        Over the past 4-5 centuries the portrayal of music has dramatically changed in many
        different ways. This page focuses on the 4.5 periods since 1685, as described on the home
        page.
        <br><br>The first period is known as the Baroque period, and it is recognized to have lasted
        for pretty much the life of J.S. Bach, from his birth in 1685 to his death in 1750. The Baroque
        period is characterized by its heavy use of motifs and static but sudden dynamic changes... blah 
        blah blah. This is an informational site, I am not going to add literally everything here.
        <br><br> Classical period... Known for greater ranges of dynamics and more creativity than Baroque...
        Notable composers... Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, Schubert etc.
        <br><br> Romantic Period... Known for much more grandieur, much more emotion (Not that there wasn't 
        As much in previous periods, this one just took it to another level)... Notable composers... Liszt, 
        Rachmaninoff, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. 
        <br><br> Impressionist Period... The half period. Watercolor-like. Not going into much detail.
        <br><br> Contemporary Period... The modern period. Everything went out the window, music is now 
        Turing complete. Write a piece in the phrygian mode and 13/8, except every 3 measures it's 15/8 just 
        to piss everyone off. Notable composers? I'll do this later. I don't know if John Cage counts.

      <h3>Music Theory Basics</h3>
      <p>
        Again, I'm not going to go over everything I want to go here. I actually am planning on extending
        this site to more than 3 pages so I can go into advanced music theory, but I'll just do the basics 
        part so I can focus on the actual website-building part.<br><br>
        I'll probably start with going over note pitches and durations, (ABCDEFG#b and lengths) and then 
        I'll introduce the staves, go over measures, times, tempos, and possibly a bunch of other stuff.
        This is just the page for basic music theory, so I'm still debating on whether or not I'll include 
        chord progressions, upper neighbor and similar crap, etc.
