        <h2>0 Introduction</h2>
        <a href="https://nab42.github.io/wdd130/cronumusic">Personal Site Link</a>
        <p>
            <strong>Subject<br></strong>I picked classical music theory and history as my subject because it has always interested me and I was interested in creating a centralized site that could teach all of it. Obviously I wasn't able to make the whole site (all of the information that I wanted) by the time of the deadline, but I thought getting a start on it would be a great way to work on my website creation skills.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Audience<br></strong>
            This website was aimed at anybody aiming to learn more about music theory. My idea was it could be useful for both people who knew next to nothing about music theory and also people who knew quite a bit and wanted to look up something quickly. Of course as the website is currently that wouldn't be the case, because I only put in enough content to make my styling and HTML function properly and meet smaller goals. However, that is my targeted audience for this site. 
        </p>
        <h2>1 Goals/Objectives</h2>
        <p>
            My main goal for this website is, as I explained above, to create a centralized website dedicated to teaching others different fundamentals of music theory. I believe music is an incredible tool to portray emotions, send messages, stay sane, and share talent. One who understands music theory well can create amazing piece of music that evoke emotion in a way that very few other things do. Music can help create empathy in others, and and is also just a great outlet in general. If I teach others how inner functions of music theory I can spread the creation of music all around. 
            <br><br>
            My other goal is pretty obvious, as I am in the Web Fundamentals class. My secondary goal is to improve and get better at using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing websites. I think I succeeded pretty well in this, although I have to get better at understanding what other people think looks good as opposed to my own views, as they often differ (If you want to know what I mean, I think this page is a good example of what my idea of what a website should look like is). 
        </p>
        <h2>2 Design Process</h2>
        <p>
            My original approach when creating my wireframes was to ask, 'how should I group my different parts of my website?' I eventually came to the decision to make my two subpages about history and basics. After that, the rest of the grouping was pretty easy. For the history section, I could just make little 'cards' that did each period. Then for the basics, I would just do the same thing for continuity purposes, and figure out what to put in each card. I considered using those accordian components we learned in class, but figured that cards would be better-suited for the feel of my website.
            <br>
            In all honesty the wireframes took me about 5 minutes each once I figured out what I wanted to do. I did them on paper because I felt like a pencil could help me create a better visualization. 
            <br><br>
            My original wireframe cards on each page had titles and some had background pictures. However, not long after implementing these cards I quickly realized that they did not fit well with the look and feel I was going for, so I removed them. I also realized that rounded corners and floating navs and footers would look better for the feel too, so I went ahead and did that.
        </p>
        <h2>3 Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Overall I feel like I learned a lot in making this website. The biggest thing I learned is that I am not great at designing websites, but if I put my mind to it I can implement exactly the style I want. I hope I am able to allocate time to improving this website and make it the information hoard that I originally hoped for it to be. I'm glad I took this class. I came into it not expecting much, because I already knew a lot about HTML and CSS, and I came out of it learning way more than I thought I would. Layouts, displays, and a few other small CSS things have been very useful for me to know. I have a much better understanding of how HTML and CSS work now. And maybe when I return from my mission I might take WDD230 after doing a little bit of review. I have always wanted to get good at making websites and this class really helped me get closer to that. Maybe one day I will figure out how to design websites that look professional to other people.
