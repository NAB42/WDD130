            Hey everyone! I am currently a Computer Science Major, although when it gets 
            approved I will probably switch to a Cybersecurity Major. I am a Freshman at BYU-I, and I love
            it so far. I already have quite a bit of experience with HTML and CSS, but I still think this will be a 
            fun class!<br><br>I have a few hobbies. Probably my top one is music. I love playing the piano and trombone,
            and I my favorite thing to do on them is improvisation. I have considered minoring in music a couple times,
            which would be quite a unique Major-minor pair. I also like screwing around on computers. I spend a lot of 
            my free time teaching myself different programming languages and techniques. I also like hiking and 
            working on cars. <br><br>
            I am very excited to get to know you all!
