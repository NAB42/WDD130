    <h1>Minecraft Ubuntu Startup Instructions</h1>

    <h2>Step 0</h2>
    <p>
        Make sure everything is hooked up. VGA cord from monitor, power supply cord, keyboard and mouse. The monitor also has its own plug to go into the wall. Also make sure the ethernet cord is hooked up as well.
        <br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>
        Start the machine by pressing the power button on the tower. If the monitor is not turned on, turn that on as well by pressing the power button on the monitor too. It takes a long time due to the slowness of the hard drive, but eventually the Ubuntu logo under the Dell logo will appear. After loading for a while, the lock screen will appear.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>
        Once the lock screen is on, click on the user (nacho) and enter the password. After another long wait, eventually the desktop will appear. If you forgot the password text me, but it should be pretty easy to guess if you have.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>
        Once on the desktop, there should be a folder called 'serv'. It should be right on the desktop. Double click that folder, and it should be obviously a minecraft server. In that folder is a file that ends in '.jar'. That is the actually server running software. In that folder right-click and click on the 'open in terminal' option.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>
        After opening the terminal, a text-based command thingy should appear that says 'nacho@nacho:~/Desktop/serv$' with the cursor just after that. Type in 'java -jar cra' and then hit tab. It should autofill. Once you press enter, the server should start. If pressing tab does not autocomplete, just type in the name of that '.jar' file.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>
        The server is now running! To turn it off, just type 'stop' and wait for that 'nacho@nacho' thing to appear. Then, type 'sudo reboot' if you want to reboot the system (password required) or 'shutdown 0' to shut the computer down.
